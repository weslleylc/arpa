# ARPA: Analytical Recursive Pairwise Aggregation

## Overview

ARPA is a Python package designed for feature selection using various information-theoretic measures. It includes implementations for mutual information, conditional mutual information, and other related metrics. The package also provides tools for visualizing the results using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

## Installation

You can install ARPA from PyPI:

```bash
pip install arpa
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the ARPA feature selection transformer, you can follow the example below:

```python
from arpa.transformer import FeatureSelectionTransformer
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Initialize ARPA transformer
arpa = FeatureSelectionTransformer(k=2, function='shannon.process_call_corrcoef')

# Fit the transformer
arpa.fit(X, y)

# Transform the dataset
X_transformed = arpa.transform(X)
```

### Visualization

ARPA provides functions to visualize the feature selection process. Here is an example of how to draw a tree and components:

```python
import networkx as nx
from arpa.plot import graph

# Create a sample graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])

# Draw the tree
graph.draw_tree(G, root=0)

# Draw the components
graph.draw_components(G, round=1)
```

## API Reference

### `FeatureSelectionTransformer`

A transformer for feature selection using various information-theoretic measures.

#### Parameters

- `k` (int): Number of features to select.
- `costs` (array-like, optional): Precomputed cost matrix.
- `function` (callable): Function to compute the cost between features.
- `precision` (int): Precision for discretization.
- `verbose` (int): Verbosity level.
- `processes` (int): Number of processes to use for computation.

#### Methods

- `fit(X, y)`: Fit the transformer to the data.
- `transform(X)`: Transform the data to select the top `k` features.

### `shannon_information`

Module containing functions to compute various information-theoretic measures.

#### Functions

- `compute_mi(x, y, n_neighbors=3, noise_type=None)`: Compute mutual information between two variables.
- `compute_cmi(x, y, z, n_neighbors=3, noise_type=None)`: Compute conditional mutual information between two variables given a third.

### `plot`

Module containing functions to visualize the feature selection process.

#### Functions

- `draw_tree(T, root=0, figsize=(30, 12), decimals=3, node_list=None, path=None, mapping=None, show_labels=False)`: Draw a tree representation of the feature selection process.
- `draw_components(G, round, figsize=(10, 8), mapping=None, path=None)`: Draw the components of the feature selection process.
